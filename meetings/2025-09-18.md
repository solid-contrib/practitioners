- Dealing with Typescript and ESM madness.
- RG: Using JSDocs for typings. Best to require ESM, don't write CommonJS for new code.
- Node 24 implements [type stripping](https://tc39.es/proposal-type-annotations/).
- ... (lots of stuff for elf to add links for his projects) https://github.com/elf-pavlik/solid-efforts-core/commits/main/

#### Marc

(just to leave it in the minutes)

#### Erich

- Pathology engine mgmt system on Solid/LWS.
- Stress testing it with 60K images from Stony Brook.
- Mini Demo of image stacking.
- Fuse system to mount data.
- eP: Do you have map-tiling? have looked at TREE spec?
- [IIIF](https://iiif.io/) is a simple URL protocol for accessing images on a server. Tiling engines understand these requests and returns partial images to the user-agent.
- RG: What about conneg?
- We could do Range Requests if we have a way to translate Ranges to tiling, we can move tiling engine to client
- eP: speaking of hypermedia, I'm looking into https://tree.linkeddatafragments.org/
